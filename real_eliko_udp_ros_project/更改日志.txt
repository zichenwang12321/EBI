Use Matlab to read Quadra sensor and send data through UDP
Matlab can perhaps acquire only 1 cycle of data and then sends this pack
For impedance sensing, perhaps, the first cycle of measurement can be noisy due to parasitic capacitance. You can ask matlab to read, for instance, 3 cycles of data, and then send the last cycle of data.
